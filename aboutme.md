Hi everyone!

I am currently enjoying life as a assistant professor in Computer Science at
Aalborg University in the Human-Centered Computing research group.
My research is situated within HCI and Participatory Design, and I focus on understanding,
modeling and improving digital tools and activities that support design-based collaboration in a
range of domains, primarily with a civic bent. I work by collaborating with industrial partners,
municipalities, and users on real-life problems. These efforts lead to models and frameworks
for understanding empowerment in different domains, as well as prototypes that demonstrate
value in natural settings and acts as bridges between academic research and practical concerns.



I urge you to check out the [Publications](../publications) and [Teaching](../teaching) sections of the website.
