I am a prolific collaborator - as you might have noticed almost all of my work is coauthored and my doctoral and postdoctoral work happened in two major research projects: [Creativity in Blended Interaction Spaces](https://cavi.au.dk/projects/cibis/) during my PhD at Aarhus University, and the [Smart Technologies, Empowered Citizens](https://stec.design) during my postdoc at the TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Currently I am part of the [DREAMS(Digitally supported Environmental  Assessment for Sustainable  Development Goals)](https://www.dreamsproject.dk) project here at Aalborg University.

Recent workshops I have given include "Is that really Participatory Design" (at [OpenLab, Newcastle University](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/)), where I outlined Participatory Design as a world/view and methodology, and then guided early career researchers in analyzing their research projects using PD as a lens. Another emblematic talk is "Introduction to CoDesign methods" at [Industrial Design TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-design/) where I outline and discussed with students at the education there how involving users and domain experts in creating design ideas might be a fruitful approach - and how to do it.

## Student projects
Since my work is closely intertwined with practice it makes lots of sense to have students involved in my work. What I often do is that I work with students relevant to my
