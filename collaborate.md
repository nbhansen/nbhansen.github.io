I am a prolific collaborator - as you might have noticed almost all of my work is coauthored and my doctoral and postdoctoral work happened in two major research projects: [Creativity in Blended Interaction Spaces](https://cavi.au.dk/projects/cibis/) during my PhD at Aarhus University, and the [Smart Technologies, Empowered Citizens](https://stec.design) during my postdoc at the TU Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Currently I am part of the [DREAMS(Digitally supported Environmental  Assessment for Sustainable  Development Goals)](https://www.dreamsproject.dk) project here at Aalborg University.

Below I outline a few of the typical ways to collaborate with me - don't feel sad if I didn't use OUR collaboration as an example. These are mostly chosen for their ability to communicate what I do with people.

## Giving a talk or a workshop
I love giving talks and workshops, both at academic and industry venues or at the local highschool. I simply just love getting out there you know?

Recent workshops I have given include *"Is that really Participatory Design"* (at [OpenLab, Newcastle University](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/)), concerning Participatory Design as a world/view and methodology, and guided early career researchers in analyzing their research projects using PD as a lens. Another emblematic talk is *"Introduction to CoDesign methods"* at [Industrial Design TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-design/) where I outline and discussed with students how involving users and domain experts in creating design ideas might be a fruitful approach - and how to do it.

## Student projects
Since my work is closely intertwined with practice it makes lots of sense to have students involved in my work. What I often do is that I work with students relevant to my research agenda on their own projects.

For instance, I collaborated with a group of students at the Master in Digital Design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam on a project where they created an interactive installation *Minicipality* that aimed to use play and games to make local citizens more aware of possibilities of engaging in developing their own neighborhood. You can read more about that here [The Minicipality - Creating a platform for citizen participation](https://www.masterdigitaldesign.com/case/game-the-minicipality).

------ conext picture ----
In another example, I supervised [the bachelors project of Anna Smulders](https://absmulders.wixsite.com/mijnsite-3/final-bachelor-project) and while all credit must go to Anna for her brilliant work, it is also an example of her and my interests intersecting - she created the Conext; A discussion tool for next level co-creation at citizen-evenings by making connections. The goal of this project was to empower citizens during the redevelopment of their city within the co-creation process at citizen-evenings. This project neatly combined my interests in *citizen empowerment* as well as tools for participatory design.  

In general I am open to student projects of all types and kinds, and I have a lot of experience collaborating with companies and external stakeholders. During my PhD I worked with LEGO and a series of architectural companies, and in my time in the Netherlands I worked together with students with Philips and KPN.

So do hit me up :)

## Co-authoring papers
Last, I am always open to co-authoring papers - I want to go as to say that I love nothing more than the rush of minds meeting, and I think its always fantastic when things come together. I have obviously written a lot of papers with people whom I also shared project funding with (see above), but recently I have also begun writing more with people who I like and who I share interests with. So again - do hit me up :)
