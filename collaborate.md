I am a prolific collaborator - as you might have noticed almost all of my work is coauthored and my doctoral and postdoctoral work happened in two major research projects: CIBIS (link!!) and STEC(link!!!). While partly a consequence of contemporary academia, I also enjoy working with others more often than not.

Below I outline a few of the typical ways to collaborate with me and at the end, you will find a few examples of collaborations that I especially appreciate (don't feel sad if you are not mentioned here - this section is very much a work in process)

#Giving a talk or a workshop
I love giving talks and workshops, both at academic and industry venues or at the local highschool. I simply just love getting out there you know?

Recent workshops I have given include "Is that really Participatory Design" (at [OpenLab, Newcastle University](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/)), where I outlined Participatory Design as a world/view and methodology, and then guided early career researchers in analyzing their research projects using PD as a lens. Another emblematic talk is "Introduction to CoDesign methods" at [Industrial Design TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-design/) where I outline and discussed with students at the education there how involving users and domain experts in creating design ideas might be a fruitful approach - and how to do it.
