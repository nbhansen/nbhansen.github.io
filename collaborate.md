I am a prolific collaborator - as you might have noticed almost all of my work is coauthored and my doctoral and postdoctoral work happened in two major research projects: CIBIS (link!!) and STEC(link!!!). While partly a consequence of contemporary academia, I also enjoy working with others more often than not.

Below I outline a few of the typical ways to colalborate with me and at the end, you will find a few examples of collaborations that I especially appreciate (don't feel sad if you are not mentioned here - this section is very much a work in process)
