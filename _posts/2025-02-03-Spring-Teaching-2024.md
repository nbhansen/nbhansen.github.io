This spring I will be teaching, for the last time **cries** the course I helped develop on Functional and Graphical Protototyping on the Bachelors education in Interaction Design. Its an introductory course that blends insights into using Figma with theoretical and practical knowledge of the hows, whens and whys of prototyping.
