title: What do Hackathons Do?

subtitle: New (best) paper out @ CHI 2021
---

I have long had an interest in *program theory* a specific approach to evaluation the mechanisms and effects of different design activities. See for instance  [this paper from OZCHI 2019](../files/Hansen_et_al_2019_preprintOZCHI.pdf) 

Together with my good friends Jeanette Falk (Aarhus University) and Gopinaath Kannabiran (IT University of Copenhagen) I was lucky enough to not only get accepted into the finest conference our field have, CHI, but also win a **best paper award**. While such things are of course mighty subjective, I am also quite pleased with the accolade even though the bulk of the credit must go to Jeanette and Gopinaath. 

A preprint of our paper can be [downloaded here](../files/Falk_et_al_2021_preprintCHI.pdf) and listen to Jeanette explain it all on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7He-GOIP-Rk). 

The abstract goes a little something like this: 

*Hackathons are increasingly embraced across diverse sectors as a way of  democratizing the design of technology. Several attempts have been made  to redefine the format and desired end goal of hackathons in recent  years thereby warranting closer methodological scrutiny. In this paper,  we apply program theory to analyze the processes and effects of 16  hackathon case studies through published research literature. Building  upon existing research on hackathons, our work offers a critical  perspective examining the methodological validity of hackathons and  exemplifies how specific processes for organizing hackathons are  modified for different purposes. Our main contribution is a program  theory analysis of hackathon formats that provides an exploration and  juxtaposition of 16 case studies in terms of causal relations between  the input, process and the effects of hackathons. Our cataloguing of  examples can serve as an inspirational planning resource for future  organizers of hackathons.*
