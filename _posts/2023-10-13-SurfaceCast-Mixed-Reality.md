SurfaceCast is a super-flexible open-source streaming toolkit that lets you create shared interactive surfaces from a huge variety of devices, merging up to four separate locations into one shared mixed reality space.

Examples for what you can build: hybrid physical-virtual whiteboard (a), remote piano teaching (b), "dining at a distance" (c), distributed physical board games or puzzles (d).

I have been lucky enough to be a small part of this, and the idea is to collaborate on more usecases such as hybrid and distributed co-design approaches and whatever else we can cook up.
