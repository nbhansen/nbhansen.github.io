Aided by anthropics Claude, I finally managed to cut through the clutter of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and actually setup a workflow for running this site like I want. Very simply, the actual code can be seen on my [Github](https://github.com/nbhansen/nbhansen.github.io). In a nutshell its just a Jekyll server running locally that with the aid of a bunch of smaller linux scripts allows me to use VSCode (or any other markdown editor basically) to remove all friction from writing posts - **technical friction that is** - I sadly still have to write the actual posts but lets see now my blood is up. 


## The magic (?!?)
Its not REALLY magic but okay basically there are five bash scripts for a range of blog-related activities, like creating new posts from a markdown template, formatting images the right way, and accessing and uploading to the ftp-server at the venerable danish hosting company [www.webhosting.dk](https://www.webhosting.dk). Check out a diagram of the magic (?!?) here: 

## so uhm... why not wordpress or something else?
Well, I am a giant nerd, is the first reason. Second, I love the idea of my site here consisting ONLY OF STATIC HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT i mean... its so fast right. Thats why.
