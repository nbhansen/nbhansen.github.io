Today I officially joined the [GIRAF project](https://giraf.cs.aau.dk/en/about-giraf/). GIRAF is a Giraf is a tablet environment aimed at autistic children with little or no verbal communication. It can be used for daily schedules, games and education. 

My role will be as part-researcher and part SCRUM-style product owner in the sense that I will be managing connections with stakeholders in the project (institutions that teach children with autism) and the student projects that run every semester. The project is Open Source - [more documentation can be found here.](https://aau-giraf.github.io/wiki/).

The way that GIRAF is developed, is that 5-8 student groups at computer science AAU run a semester-long SCRUM project that develops different parts of the environment. The project has been running for a long time, but is now coming into its own - in the future I plan to try to run GIRAF in closer collaboration also with the stakeholders as well as maybe students at interaction design.
