I am Nicolai Brodersen Hansen, an Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction researcher, working on empowerment through tools, platforms and design processes. I hold a PhD from Aarhus University, have previously worked at the TU Eindhoven, and am currently enjoying life as an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.hcc.aau.dk/" target="_blank">the department of Computer Science, Aalborg University</a>. 

On site you will find a bit more about me, my research publications, current and past projects and my views on various things. In short, its a professional website so you know, the stuff you expect to find on one of those.
